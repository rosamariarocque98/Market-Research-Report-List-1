<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dural Graft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Graft</li><li>Non Absorbable Graft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dural graft market is categorized into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable grafts. Absorbable grafts gradually dissolve within the body, promoting natural tissue regeneration and eliminating the need for removal, making them suitable for short-term support. Conversely, non-absorbable grafts remain intact long-term, providing sustained structural support and stability, which is essential in complex medical procedures. Both types are critical in neurosurgery and spinal surgery, addressing challenges related to dural repairs and enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
