<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venovenous (VV) Artificial Lung Devices</li><li>Venoarterial (VA) Artificial Lung Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial lung devices market is categorized into two primary types: venovenous (VV) and venoarterial (VA) artificial lung devices. VV devices are designed to oxygenate blood from the veins, suitable for patients with severe respiratory issues but intact heart function. In contrast, VA devices provide both oxygenation and circulatory support by capturing blood from veins and returning it to the arteries, making them ideal for patients with combined cardiac and pulmonary failures. Each device serves distinct clinical needs in critical care.</p></p>
