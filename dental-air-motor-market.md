<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Air Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Spray</li><li>External Spray</li><li>Without Spray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental air motor market is categorized into three types based on spray mechanisms. Internal spray motors integrate a coolant spray system within the handpiece, enhancing cooling during procedures. External spray motors direct a coolant externally, allowing for effective temperature control without direct contact. Motors without spray operate solely using air pressure and do not feature any cooling mechanism, making them simpler but potentially less efficient for prolonged dental work. These distinctions cater to varying procedural needs in dentistry.</p></p>
