<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Steam Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Steam Valve</li><li>Double Acting Steam Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic steam valves market comprises two primary types: single acting steam valves and double acting steam valves. Single acting steam valves operate using compressed air to move the valve in one direction, relying on a spring for return motion, making them simpler and less expensive. In contrast, double acting steam valves utilize compressed air for both opening and closing actions, providing more precise control. This makes double acting valves preferable for applications requiring enhanced accuracy and responsiveness in steam management.</p></p>
